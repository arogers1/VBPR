# BPR/VBPR Implementation and Demo
In this repo you will find my implementation of BPR and VBPR (paper for BPR: https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1205/1205.2618.pdf, paper for VBPR: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.01784.pdf). All code here is written by me as an example of my ability to understand academic papers and turn them into code and apply them effectively to solve a problem.

## Setup
To fully run this, you will need to have Python 3 installed along with all packages listed in requirements.txt.
However, you can simply install Jupyter Notebook to view "BPR and VBPR Demo.ipynb" to view the notebook and see the results of the demo."# VBPR"
